# 1-100-secound-proxy
## Features

- **Proxy Validation**: The script checks the validity of proxies using `httpbin.org/ip` to verify that the proxy is working.
- **Proxy Rotation**: Once a proxy is verified as active, it will be used in the rotation. Active proxies are set periodically in the `proxychains` configuration.
- **Environment Support**: The script supports both Termux (Android) and Kali Linux environments.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: The active proxies are continuously monitored and rotated, updating the configuration file for `proxychains`.
